# SeleniumAssignment
Test Cases for Google based search.
I have followed the Page Object Pattern as mentioned in the assignment.
Hence, all the page related java files are present in src/main/java folder and all the test related files are present in src/test/java folders.
As per question 3, I could not find the option "Flat Earth View" on Google Maps. So, I have used "Street View" as the close alternative. This could also be the case of unclear requirement. 
I have demonstrated both page level as well as test method level assertions.
